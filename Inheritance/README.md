# ðŸ”¢ Scientific Calculator in Java

> A simple scientific calculator built in Java using **inheritance** and **basic OOP concepts**.

This project demonstrates how a child class can extend the functionality of a parent class, and how trigonometric operations can be integrated using Javaâ€™s built-in `Math` library.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with error handling for division by 0)
- Scientific operations:
  - Sine
  - Cosine
- Demonstrates **inheritance** (`SciCalc` extends `Calculator`)
- Clean method structure for each operation

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- âœ… **Inheritance** (Extending `Calculator` in `SciCalc`)
- âœ… **Method definitions and usage**
- âœ… **Encapsulation** (using public methods)
- âœ… **Error handling**
- âœ… Use of **Java Math library** for scientific functions
