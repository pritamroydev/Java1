# ðŸš— Java Interface Demonstration - Vehicles

This project demonstrates the use of **Interfaces** and **Polymorphism** in Java using a simple Vehicle system.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- **Interfaces**
  - `Vehicle`: Common contract for all vehicles
  - `ElectricVehicle`: Contract for electric-specific features
- **Polymorphism**
  - An array of `Vehicle` can hold any object that implements `Vehicle`
- **Multiple Interface Implementation**
  - `EVCar` implements both `Vehicle` and `ElectricVehicle`
- **Dynamic Method Dispatch**
  - At runtime, the appropriate implementation is called
